The corrected CSS rule is as follows:

```css
.element {
  clip-path: polygon(0 0, 100% 0, 100% 100%, 0 100%);
}
```

This removes the extra `50% 50%` coordinate from the `polygon()` shape, thus making it a valid closed shape for the clipping path.  This results in the expected rendering of the element.
